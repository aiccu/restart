The general guidelines will not be in any way prescriptive. Instead, the guidelines are designed to help universities and colleges consider all aspects of a restart. Each university and college will need to tailor their restart based on their own institution’s unique activities and students as well as within the guidelines from counties and the state. Our hope is that the end-product will be comprehensive checklists to help our diverse institutions plan for restart safely and smartly on our campuses within the guidelines from our counties and the state. Additionally, we will share the document with Lande Ajose in the Governor’s Office to inform them our efforts, the critical process we have undertaken as institutions to ensure the health and safety of our students and community; and to inform their decision making process as they develop guidance. In short, we know reopening our campuses will required changing current operations to ensure the safety and ability of us to continue to deliver high quality higher education. 0.1 Focus Areas We will focus our efforts on five areas: 0.2 Broader Context The survey, designed to be short and capture immediate and longer-term financial impacts, was sent out in early April and analysis began two weeks thereafter.Here, the immediate financial impact means the financial impact from rapid decisions needed around the Spring 2020 period, as well as the summer. Harder to determine are the longer-term financial impact, which are grounded in lower enrollment or the shift to a fully online term in fall 2020. Given how rapidly changing this situation is, these results should be seen as “point-in-time”. Considering the wide-ranging financial impact of COVID-19 and the difficulty of knowing the scale of CDC recommendations going into the fall, AICCU hopes to continue to assess the range of possible scenarios and update. 0.3 Supporting Documents The following materials have helped inform AICCU’s approach in thinking through these projections: UC Document: “PLANNING FOR RESUMPTION” McKinsey Report: Coronavirus COVID-19: Perspectives for Higher Education (4/6) UCF Typology (4/23/20): Useful Scenarios looking at the fall. Helpful categorization of how things could go How is higher ed thinking about fall? These four cases, in @UCF's board materials for a meeting today, are telling. Best case still has no international students. Worst case resumes face to face as late as fall 2021. pic.twitter.com/Pngwxbtnsx — Lindsay Ellis (@lindsayaellis) April 23, 2020 0.3.1 McKinsey’s Nerve Center Framework 0.4 Members "],
